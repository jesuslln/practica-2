            <q>
        The open, global internet is the most powerful
        communication and collaboration resource we
        have ever seen. It embodies some of our deepest
        hopes for human progress. It enables new
        opportunities for learning, building a sense of shared
        humanity, and solving the pressing problems facing
        people everywhere.
            </q>

        <br>
        <br>

            <q>
        Over the last decade we have seen this promise
        fulfilled in many ways. We have also seen the power
        of the internet used to magnify divisiveness, incite
        violence, promote hatred, and intentionally manipulate
        fact and reality. <b>We have learned that we should more
        explicitly set out our aspirations for the human
        experience of the internet. We do so now. </b>
